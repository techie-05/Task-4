- **Objective**: Build a binary classification model using logistic regression for breast cancer classification.  
- **Data Preprocessing**:  
  - Handled null values to maintain data integrity.  
  - Removed unnecessary columns to focus on relevant features.  
  - Standardized features for improved model performance.  
- **Model Training**:  
  - Applied logistic regression to distinguish between malignant and benign cases.  
  - Used the **sigmoid function** to convert linear outputs into probabilities.  
- **Model Evaluation**:  
  - Plotted the **ROC-AUC curve** to visualize classification performance.  
  - Used a **confusion matrix** to assess model accuracy.  
- **Threshold Tuning**:  
  - Adjusted the classification boundary to optimize predictions.  
- **Conclusion**:  
  - This structured approach improves breast cancer classification.  
  - The model provides insights valuable for early diagnosis and medical decision-making.
